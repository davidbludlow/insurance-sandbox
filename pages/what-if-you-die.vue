    If you die. Sorry about that. <br /><br />
    <h3>If you have a positive Medical Insurance Balance</h3>
    <p>The money will act like life insurance does.</p>
    <h3>If your balance is negative</h3>
    <p>
      Your negative balance will be paid with other peoples' Medical Insurance
      Balances (other people who use your same medical insurance company).
